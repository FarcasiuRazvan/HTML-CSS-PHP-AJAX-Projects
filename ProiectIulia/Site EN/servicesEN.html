<h3>Extra!!</h3>
    <p>Proofreading is crucial in terms of turning a good translation into an excellent translation. Why? Because no matter how good the translator is, human errors can still occur, and the flow and message of a text can be lost as a result. Sometimes, a fresh pair of eyes is exactly what’s needed to find and correct anything that could prevent your translation from reaching its full potential.</p>
    
    <p>Our regular clients understand that when it comes to producing a translation of the highest quality, it’s the details that count. That’s why every day, more and more people are getting on board with our proofreading service. Even if your original translation hasn’t been done by us, we’ll be more than happy to have a second look at it. This way, you’ll be guaranteed a translation that stands out from the rest.</p>
